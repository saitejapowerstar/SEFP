my passion project is movie store which consists of latest movie new releases,it's trailers,videos,songs,reviews,making 
videos 
etc.., all these stuff. This app also provides online movie ticket booking so that the users feel free to use the app.
I use PHP programming language to build this movie store.And also,I have to collect 
the movie information regarding past and present movies and display what are the top 10 or 25 movies which grossed or 
shared highest in the respective year.This results in users using the movie store frequently.
I have to update the information every day so that the user should not feel discomfort.
